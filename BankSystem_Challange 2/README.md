# Challange Chapter 2 - Basic Banking System

## Study Case

ðŸš©Welcome to the Basic Banking System! This simple yet effective system allows you to manage your finances easily. It's built using the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and simulates asynchronous transaction operations. With this system, you can deposit and withdraw money securely.

## Criteria to be accomplished:

1. Create a new GitHub repository named "Basic-Banking-System."
2. Copy the bank_account.js file from Challenge 1 to the project directory in the new repository.
3. Create a new JavaScript file named banking_system.js.
4. Implement the BankAccount class with deposit() and withdraw() methods.
5. Use setTimeout() to simulate asynchronous transaction operations.
6. Commit and push the changes to the GitHub repository.

## The steps:

- Create a new GitHub repository named Basic-Banking-System.
- Copy the bank_account.js file from Challenge 1 to the project directory in the new repository. This file will contain the definition of the BankAccount class used in the banking system implementation.
- Create a new JavaScript file named banking_system.js. This file will serve as the central implementation of the banking system using the OOP concept.
- Implement the BankAccount class with at least two methods:

1. deposit(amount): This method will receive the amount of money to be deposited into the account.
2. withdraw(amount): This method will receive the amount of money to be withdrawn from the account, provided that the balance is sufficient.

- Use the setTimeout() function to simulate asynchronous transaction operations. For example, after performing a deposit or withdrawal, you can delay the execution for a few seconds before returning the operation's result.
